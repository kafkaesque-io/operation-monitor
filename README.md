# Operation Monitoring for Pulsar Cluster
Pulsar Monitor monitors the availability, tracks the performance, and reports failures of the Pulsar cluster. It produces synthetic workloads to measure end-to-end message pubsub latency.

It is a cloud native application that can be installed by Helm within the Pulsar Kubernetes cluster.
